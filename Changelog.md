#### Now depends on Red Core 0.5
#### Now depends on MixinBooter 8.6

### Changed

- Lighting engine will now schedule updates no matter if that chunk is loaded, which is different from vanilla but potentially fix areas lighting being weird when going far away
- Made the logic for capping the client updates per frame dumber which should fix performance drops on lower end hardware (Fixes [#20](https://github.com/Red-Studio-Ragnarok/Alfheim/issues/20))
- Made all head-cancels overwrite instead
- All overwrites now make the scope of the overwritten methods `public` to prevent access level conflicts at runtime
